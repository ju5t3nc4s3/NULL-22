            NULL-22    (NOT-A-GLOCK_V2)
This time around there will be no detailed build guide,, All the hard work last time and no one even cared to read it.
The NULL is in the size of a G19  to have more room and make it more reliable and durable.
I am releasing this this way do to everything that happend during the NaG release. And only able to do this becouse
all the people that donated to keep me stocked up on filament and all the other needed materials. The way i did the donations
to get access in the telegram groups was the only way i got the donations. So thank you to all of you that donated.
